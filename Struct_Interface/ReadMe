#Dependencies:

1- pytest 7.1.2       # pip install pytest

#Explanation:

In this task first we define a abstract class by inheriting it from ABC module and define all the abstract methods
that we want users to implement when implementing concrete class. Then we implement concrete class and implement all
the methods. Then in the next part we write test for concrete class using pytest module which is python unit test
module and run pytest to check if test fails or passes using command:

    python -m pytest
